The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "\n",
    "I tried several different models and feature settings instead of sticking to just one baseline. I first used logistic regression with word-level TF–IDF, then added character-level TF–IDF and some simple style features. I trained both logistic regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes on these features and then combined them using a soft-voting ensemble. I also briefly played with a transformer-based model, but it was too slow on my local machine. In the end, I picked the ensemble with the enhanced TF–IDF features as my best setup based on macro F1 on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "From these experiments I realized that improving features mattered more than just switching models. Adding character-level TF–IDF and simple style features helped the minority classes more than changing the classifier. Macro F1 also made the class imbalance very clear, so I had to care about disgust and fear, not only joy. Finally, a simple ensemble of logistic regression and Naive Bayes gave a small but consistent gain with almost no extra cost.\n",
